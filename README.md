This project applies meta-learning techniques to an image classification task involving three classes: bike, car, and truck.
The goal is to build a meta-model capable of quickly adapting to new tasks with only a few examples (few-shot learning), using a neural network-based approach.

The notebook includes:

Task generation for meta-learning.

Training and evaluation of a simple Meta-Learner.

Performance assessment on unseen classes.
